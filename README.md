# PostRelational_HIS
A post relational implementation of a Hostipal Information System, using Postgres.
In this repository you can find the Entity Relationship Diagram of the relational database we used.
In the post relational implementation we took advantage of postgresql's capability to create composite data types.
We also used the capability to insert data in an array type for one cell.
The result is a more compact form of the final database.
A file with various types of INSERT and SELECT commands is also included to demonstrate the performance of the final post-relational result
